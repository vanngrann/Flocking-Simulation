# Flocking-Simulation
This simple flocking program demonstrates flocking of groups as well as attraction and avoiding points added to the environment

There is a small menu when right-clicking on screen to select a few options (options are also avaiable through keyboard shortcuts)

Menu Option 1: add 1 entity
Menu Option 2: bulk add 5 entities
Menu Option 3: add attraction point
Menu Option 4: add avoiding point
Menu Option 5: Exit program

Each entity park of the "flock" is represented by a glittering triangle floating across the screen. 
The lines on each entity represent cohesion, acceleration, and direction.
The attraction points are represented by a red dot.
  - attraction points will cause the flock to move towards or around the red dot
The avoiding points are represeneted by a blue dot.
  - avoiding points will cause the flock to move away or around the blue dot
